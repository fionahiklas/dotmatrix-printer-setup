# Dotmatrix Printer Setup

## Overview

So in a fit of nostalgia I bought a 9pin dotmatrix printer to play with but also to use for 
printing out listings of code and text since the alternative is to use a photo-quality 
Canon inkjet which is rather expensive in terms of consumables and also takes it's time in 
actually completing a print.
